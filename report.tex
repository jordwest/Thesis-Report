\section{Acknowledgments}
This thesis would not have been possible without the support of my
supervisor Dr. Mark Schulz whose input and guidance
has been invaluable for the project.

I would like to thank Dr Yuriko Nagata for her assistance with this and for allowing
me to introduce the software to her students.

Dr Michael Harrington of the School of Languages and Comparative Cultural Studies
for his advice with the online learning software, particularly the suggestion
to record the time students take to review individual words.

I would also like to thank the UQ CEIT team for their help with this project -
particularly Alan Cody and Phil Long.

Last but not least I want to thank my friends for their encouragement and
for putting up with me throughout the project, and Mum and Dad for supporting me
