\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
This thesis would not have been possible without the support of my
supervisor Dr. Mark Schulz whose input and guidance
has been invaluable for the project.

I would like to thank Dr Yuriko Nagata for her assistance with this project and for allowing
me to introduce the software to her students. I would very much like to thank the students
of JAPN1023 who participated in the project, without whom none of this would have been possible.
I hope that the students found value in using the software.

I wish to acknowledge the help of Dr Michael Harrington of the School of Languages
and Comparative Cultural Studies
for his advice with additions to the online learning software.

I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to the UQ CEIT team for their
assistance with this project --
particularly the advice and guidance of Dr. Alan Cody and Prof. Phil Long.

Last but not least I want to thank my friends for their encouragement and
for putting up with me throughout the project, and finally Mum and Dad for being there
and without whose support, care and encouragement I would never have made it this far in
my university career.

\chapter*{Abstract}
With the development of personal computers and smart phones, many new learning environments 
and learning methods are emerging. With this, educational data collection has become
 trivial and is becoming a powerful tool for improving education. This project created
 an online flash-card environment for memorising foreign vocabulary, and attempted to 
 predict whether a student will be able to recall a particular word in a target language 
 by tracking, recording and analysing reviews with machine learning techniques. 
This has many implications in education, including identifying struggling students,
identifying difficult
vocabulary to focus on, as well as improving methods of memorisation of foreign
vocabulary.
 The web based software was available from desktop and mobile devices and allowed
 students to study anywhere. Over 13 weeks, 28 students 
 completed over 7,500 reviews. The results were promising, with the system correctly 
predicting student recall of approximately 70\% of flash-card reviews. The rate of forgetting was
also plotted based on the review data, however the amount of data and number of 
reviews was too small
for any significant findings. Future work might involve a larger number of more motivated
students to gather a larger dataset.
