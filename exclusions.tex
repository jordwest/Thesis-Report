The following features are beyond the scope of this project and could be examined
in future projects.

\paragraph{Scalability}
As the system is designed with a small audience in mind, it need not be capable
of handling a load of thousands of users. On a larger scale project it may be
possible to break down users into more than just two groups in order to test
many variables individually.

\paragraph{Functionality to Dynamically Add Content}
All content (vocabulary lists) will be manually added to the system. Future
modifications might allow teaching staff to add their own vocabulary to the
system to customise it for their own class.

\paragraph{Integration With Social Networks}
Another aspect of gaming which is ignored in this project is social gaming.
Adding integration with social networks such as Facebook and Twitter could add
the complex element of peer validation to the user motivation. The social/competitive
aspect of game mechanics will not be investigated in this project.
