The software will provide `modules' which each contain some vocabulary to be learned.
The module order will correspond with the order in which the vocabulary should
be learned during semester. Each module will contain three challenges:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Vocabulary List - Displays a list of vocabulary for the user to scan
		over and memorise.
	\item Test - Test the user on their knowledge of all the vocabulary for
		that module. 
\end{enumerate}
