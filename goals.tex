\section{Goals}
\label{goals}
This project aims to develop an online learning environment to gather data on spaced repetition
reviews and to analyse that data in order to build a model of memory in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Produce Forgetting Curves
  \item Predict Student Responses
\end{itemize}

Forgetting curves will provide an immediately visible overview of how time affects chance
of recall, and how this changes after reviews of a piece of information. With these curves,
it may be possible to support Ebbinghaus' theory of the exponential decaying nature of memory
as well as to find optimal times at which to review information.

Prediction of student responses will evaluate the feasibility of predicting a student's
recall of foreign vocabulary that the student has actively been reviewing with a spaced repetition
method. With a good prediction accuracy and regular student use of the spaced repetition review
software, it might be possible in future work to predict student test scores based on
the content contained within. This project however only aims to evaluate the accuracy of
predicting reviews within the software.
