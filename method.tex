Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) which tracks changes
to source code (often amongst multiple developers) and keeps a complete history
of changes. This is invaluable when a change in code occurs that results in a critical
bug. Versions can be compared to find the change that introduced the bug, and production
code can be reverted if need be \cite{scott_chacon_pro_2009}.

Git can be hosted anywhere, however Github is a popular

Twitter Bootstrap is a set of default styles for websites and web applications, provided as open-source by Twitter. Using Twitter Bootstrap rapidly speeds up theming of a web application with default looks for navigation, buttons, text and layout.

More significantly, Twitter Bootstrap offers a 'responsive' layout 
system which provides a reduced screen size (ie. smartphone) layout
 with little to no extra work on the part of the developer. This 
 means a smartphone version of the web application could be designed
  at the same time. Twitter Bootstrap was also chosen for this reason.
