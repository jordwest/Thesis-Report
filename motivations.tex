With the success of companies such as Foursquare attributed to their game-like
features, it is difficult to determine to what extent the game-like features
have in fact contributed to their success. This project was conceived in the
hope to provide a comparison between two environments and provide a somewhat
quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the game-like features. In
particular, whether the use of such game mechanics could be used in positive
environments such as education.
