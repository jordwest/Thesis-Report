\paragraph{Personality Questionnaire}
During sign-up, the user will be asked to complete a short questionnaire about their personality. This questionnaire will be optional, however may provide some insights into the types of users for whom game mechanics are most effective. 

\paragraph{User Ratings}
Users will be asked to quickly rate their feelings about the system to gauge subjective feelings. To encourage users to complete the rating - this will only be asked occasionally and will be very short. The following questions will be included:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item I feel I am learning a lot with \SoftName.
    \item I look forward to using \SoftName\ each day
\end{enumerate}

The users will be asked to rate each question on a 5-point Likert scale \cite{likert_technique_1932} with the following options:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Strongly Disagree
	\item Disagree
	\item Neither Agree nor Disagree
	\item Agree
	\item Strongly Agree
\end{enumerate}
