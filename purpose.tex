The purpose of the project is to measure the effectiveness of applying a
subset of game mechanics to rote memorisation tasks in the study of vocabulary
in a language. By building software for this purpose, the author aims to gather
data which can quantitatively compare two otherwise identical environments 
- one which includes the selected game mechanics and one which does 
not - in terms of user engagement.

Further, the purpose is not to create a `game' as such, but rather to take some
of the components of games which are believed to make games addictive and to apply
them to a learning activity - in this case rote memorisation. The determination
of what constitutes a `game mechanic' is debatable and a
somewhat subjective topic, however for this study the game mechanics selected
have been used in many systems to date (see section \ref{background_gamemechanics}).
