\subsubsection{Extrinsic vs. Intrinsic Motivation}
Motivation is often seperated into two categories - Extrinsic and Intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation refers to the motivation one feels for a task when that person feels that completing the task is enjoyable or fulfilling. Extrinsic motivation 
\subsubsection{socialPsych}
The socialPsych\cite{landers_casual_2011} project examined some game mechanics
in an online social learning environment which was run in parallel to university
courses. The authors of the project compiled a list of best practices
for casual social games used for learning, of which a few are relevant to
the project discussed in this proposal. Immediacy of feedback (in terms of
rewards or validation for completing a task) was found to be important for
motivation \cite[p. 419]{landers_casual_2011}. Game rewards should also be adjusted
to a difficulty which is achievable without being overly easy to ensure the user
feels satisfaction upon completion \cite[p. 420]{landers_casual_2011}.
