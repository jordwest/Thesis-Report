The recent proliferation of addictive game-like features (or \textit{game mechanics}) to increase user engagement on social networks and sales websites raises the question: how effective could game mechanics be when applied in other environments, such as education? This project aims to analyse and quantify the effectiveness of the application of game mechanics to an online learning environment in motivating and engaging students. Specifically for this project the learning environment selected is the memorisation of vocabulary of a foreign language.
