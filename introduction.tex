The recent proliferation of addictive game-like features (or \textit{game mechanics}) to 
increase user engagement in non-game environments such as social networks and 
sales websites raises the question: 
How effective could game mechanics be when applied in other environments, such as 
education? This project aims to construct software and analyse and quantify the
effectiveness of the application of a subset of game mechanics to an online 
learning environment in motivating and engaging students. Specifically for 
this project the learning environment selected is the memorisation of vocabulary 
of a foreign language.
